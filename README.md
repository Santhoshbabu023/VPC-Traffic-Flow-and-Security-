# VPC-Traffic-Flow-and-Security-
This project demonstrates how to configure Amazon VPC for secure, isolated network management within AWS. It covers the setup of subnets, route tables, security groups, and network ACLs to manage traffic flow, security, and internet access.

## Key Concepts

- **Route Tables:** Configured to manage traffic routing between subnets and to the internet gateway, making the subnet public.
- **Security Groups:** Implemented to control inbound and outbound traffic at the resource level (e.g., EC2 instances).
- **Network ACLs:** Used as an additional layer of security to manage both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

## Features

- Create and manage **Route Tables** for routing traffic between resources and the internet.
- Configure **Security Groups** to control allowed inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.
- Set up **Network ACLs** to add an additional layer of security at the subnet level.
- Handle **public** and **private** subnets through routing and security settings.

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts like subnets, IP addressing, and routing.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Create a VPC**:
   - Navigate to the VPC dashboard in the AWS console.
   - Create a new VPC with a CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

2. **Create Subnets**:
   - Create public and private subnets within the VPC.

3. **Configure Route Tables**:
   - Set up a route table for the public subnet with a route to an internet gateway.

4. **Security Groups**:
   - Create a security group to control access to your EC2 instances.
   - Configure inbound and outbound rules (e.g., allow HTTP access on port 80).

5. **Network ACLs**:
   - Set up default or custom network ACLs for your VPC’s subnets.

6. **Launch EC2 Instances**:
   - Launch EC2 instances in the subnets and apply appropriate security group settings.

## In-depth Learning Topics

- **Route Tables:** Manage traffic flow within your VPC by defining rules with destination IP ranges and their corresponding targets.
- **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls that control access to resources in the cloud.
- **Network ACLs:** Stateless security controls at the subnet level, providing additional protection for your VPC.

## Conclusion

This project helps in understanding the key components of Amazon VPC, route tables, security groups, and network ACLs. By setting up these elements, you’ll ensure that your AWS resources are properly secured while managing traffic flow effectively.
